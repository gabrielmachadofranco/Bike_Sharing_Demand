# Bike Sharing Demand
Bike sharing systems are a means of renting bicycles where the process of obtaining membership, rental, and bike return is automated via a network of kiosk locations throughout a city. Using these systems, people are able rent a bike from a one location and return it to a different place on an as-needed basis. Currently, there are over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world.
The objective of this project is to use weather and climate-related data to forecast the demand for bicycles in the last ten days of each month.
